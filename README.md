# GeoWeather-Detector
This program will automatically detect your location and display the weather at your location on real-time


I have used two diffrent API's for creating this program 
Openweathermap for extracting the weather data
IPstack for detecting your current location


I have also used Tkinter to create a GUI for the output.
